Each class (or vehicle) should have 4 weapon slots. Each slot is more or
less equivalent to an ability in Dota. Only one (the first one) will 
have a weapon in it at the start of the game. By leveling up, they can
either upgrade the weapon, or get a new weapon (prolly just 4 upgrades 
per slot).

Warning System for shooting teammates
warning variable that once it hits 3, kicks the player
if IsAlly(me, GetWhoShotMe(me)) then
	players[GetTeam(GetWhoShotMe(me))].warnings = players[GetTeam(GetWhoShotMe(me))].warnings + 1
	
	if players[GetTeam(GetWhoShotMe(me))].warnings >= 3 then
		Kick(GetWhoShotMe(me))	--need to talk to Ken about getting this
	end
end

Player money is scrap
